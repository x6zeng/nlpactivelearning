The US-China relationship is changing rapidly. To better understand its dynamics,
monitoring and analyzing Twitter data posted by members of Congress becomes
important. Before analyzing the tweets, there is a need to distinguish the sentimental
posts from the factual posts and provide them with labels of different
sentiment levels. Currently, the China Data Lab at UC San Diego has been training
researchers to manually label the relevance and sentiment for the U.S. Congress
tweets about the politics of China. To increase the efficiency, we trained two classification
models that use the text features from the tweets to predict the relevance
and sentiment of the tweets. The goal of this project is to explore the possibility
of employing an active learning pipeline to automate the labeling procedure with
these two classification models while enhancing the prediction accuracy over time
with new coming tweets.
